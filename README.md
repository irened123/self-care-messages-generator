## Acknowledgements

The inspiration for this project—creating a message generator program with JavaScript—originated from Codecademy's [Full Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path). While the project task was part of the portfolio projects offered in the course, the implementation is unique and my own.
